{"body":"# Keylister\r\n\r\nKeylister is a jQuery Widget that allows the user to select any key they like for a specific song. The widget automatically injects a list of root notes to select from, and binds each of those buttons to a transpose event.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n    $( \".key-selector\" ).keylister();\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<!-- data-song of the key-selector must match the ID of the song -->\r\n<div class=\"key-selector\" data-song=\"fortunate-son\"></div>\r\n\r\n<pre id=\"fortunate-son\">\r\n    G                    F\r\n    Some folks are born made to wave the flag,\r\n    C7                          G\r\n    ooh, they're red, white and blue.\r\n    G                        F\r\n    And when the band plays \"Hail to the chief\"\r\n    C7                             G\r\n    they point the cannon right at you.\r\n    \r\n    ...\r\n</pre>\r\n```\r\n","tagline":"jQuery Widget for song key selection","note":"Don't delete this file!
