  <pre id="fortunate-son" class="song">VERSE 1: 
G                    F
Some folks are born made to wave the flag,
C7                          G
ooh, they're red, white and blue.
G                        F
And when the band plays "Hail to the chief"
C7                             G
they point the cannon right at you.

CHORUS:
G            D7           C7               G
It ain't me, it ain't me, I'm no senator's son.
G            D7           C7               G
It ain't me, it ain't me, I'm no fortunate one.

VERSE 2:
G                    F
Some folks are born silver spoon in hand,
C7                     G
Lord, don't they help themselves.
G                    F
But when the tax man comes to the door:
C7                                    G
"Lord, the house looks like a rummage sale."

CHORUS:
G            D7           C7                    G           
It ain't me, it ain't me, I'm no millionaire's son.
G            D7           C7               G 
It ain't me, it ain't me, I'm no fortunate one.

BREAK: G  Gdim  C  G

VERSE 3:
G                  F
Some folks inherit star spangled eyes,
C7                         G
ooh, they send you down to war.
G                      F
And when you ask them: "How much should we give?"
C7                                 G
Oh, they only answer: "More, more, more"

CHORUS:
G            D7           C7                G
It ain't me, it ain't me, I'm no military's son.
G            D7           C7               G
It ain't me, it ain't me, I'm no fortunate one.
